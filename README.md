# Web-Scrapper
This is currently a work in progress web scrapper that is being developed to collect the url's of images on Google. The data collected from this webscrapper would then be standardized and quantified so that it could be used as training data from a neural network. Currently the web scrapper is being used to collect images of cats and dogs in order to create a set of training data so that a convolutional neural network can learn the difference. This software is heavily reliant on imports from selenium to automate actions on the Chrome browser
